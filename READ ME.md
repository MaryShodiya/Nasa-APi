### The Process

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST API, Text-to-Speech API

An app that gives user exclusive access to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) daily explorations and scientific discovery captured through images and videos and explanation of same media. A text-to-speech application interface was added to the project for optimal readabiltity, A Resume, Pause, Cancel and Play Button was added to control the play functions of the text-to-speech api. 

## Optimization
An Input Date was added to access the data since data from the nasa-api can only be retrieved through the date syntax.

## Lessons Learnt

Had a little setback in getting the date to walk as Nasa requires a particular date format for the data to be returned.

## Resources Used
[MDN WEB DOCS TEXT-TO-Speech](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API). This resource served as a easy guide in incoporating voice data to this project.
